/* 

	uses the core13 library for arduino and attiny13 

	this takes an inverted high pulse and turns it into our 
	  unlock/lock to control a 910mhz door control 

	Also added in code to remove door-fucking-action: 
	  we expect a 2000ms inverted HIGH signal and designed 
	  around the major timing flaw with the tiny13 library of 1:1.55

	This is a functional hack, and wireless, braodcasts up to 200m

	1 tplink 703n (90rmb)
	2 npn tranistor 
	2 100Î© resistor

 	1 signal cloner (15rmb) - runs at 5v - even though it should be 12v :) 

	1 attiny13 - (10rmb) - recycle! 
   	  - resiliant, this thing was also powered the wrong way and still works!
